# ARIMA-SARIMA
Forecasting using ARIMA and SARIMA

In the attached jupyter notebook, I have used ARIMA and SARIMA modules from statsmodels 
library to make predictions on the number of passengers for an airline company using historical timeseries data.

The original data is also present in the repository in the form of a .CSV file

Libraries used :

pandas
numpy
statsmodels
pmdarima
